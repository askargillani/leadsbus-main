            <ul>
                <li><strong>Online Paid Services.</strong> For paid Services purchased online ("Online Services"), you must provide LeadsBus with a valid credit card or other payment method (e.g., PayPal account) to pay for such services. Some Services may be available as a one-time purchase, and others can be purchased as a monthly or yearly subscription. You agree that LeadsBus has permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and payment processing firms (including any institutions or firms LeadsBus retains in the future) your submitted payment information in order to process your purchase. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. LeadsBus does not support all payment methods, currencies, or locations for payment. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel or downgrade your account to a charge-free account, you authorize LeadsBus to continue billing your credit card and/or PayPal account and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.</li>

                <li><strong>Free Trial Period.</strong> If you sign up for a free trial period for a Service that is subject to charges (the "Free Trial"), we may require you to provide us with a valid credit card or other valid payment method. We may start charging you automatically on the first day after the Free Trial is over, unless you cancel or downgrade to a charge-free Service and uninstall any Apps or other items, as required for cancellation, before the end of the Free Trial period. The Free Trial is only available to first time users of a paid Online Service. We may refuse to provide our free trial period services to other users who have access to the same properties on the supported platforms i.e. the same Facebook Pages.</li>

                <li><strong>Subscription Services; Auto-renewal and Cancellation.</strong> If you are purchasing Online Services on a subscription basis, you may have the option to purchase a monthly or a yearly subscription, which will automatically renew at the end of its applicable term. Subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (as per the option chosen when you purchased such Online Services) and are non-refundable for the subscription period they are purchased for. You agree that LeadsBus may process your credit card or other valid payment method on each monthly, annual, or other renewal term (based on the applicable billing cycle), on the calendar day corresponding to the first day you subscribed to Online Services. If your paid subscription to Online Services began on a day not contained in a subsequent month (e.g., your service began on January 30 and there is no February 30), we will process your payment on the last day of such month. You may elect to cancel or downgrade your Online Services at any time by following the steps outlined at https://www.replyem.com/cancel. If you subscribed to a yearly plan, the downgrade will only be effective at the end of the then-current annual billing period and no credits or refunds will be issued to you for prepaid fees. Online Services purchased for a one-time fee are not refundable.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Late Payment.</strong> If any amounts due hereunder are not received by LeadsBus by the due date, then at LeadsBus's discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon 10 days' written notice, LeadsBus may suspend your access to the Services if LeadsBus does not receive the amounts invoiced hereunder at the expiration of such period</li>
                
                <li><strong>Taxes and Withholdings.</strong> You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchase of Services. If LeadsBus has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide LeadsBus with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If you are required to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions or withholdings, LeadsBus receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.</li>
